    "### Why This Is Challenging\n",
    "1. **Incomplete Information:** Only partial word is visible\n",

    "\n",
    "### Most Challenging Parts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Zero Overlap Constraint**\n",
    "   - Test set has NO words from training corpus\n",
    "   - Cannot rely on word memorization\n",
    "   - Must learn general English language patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generalization vs. Specificity Trade-off**\n",
    "   - Too specific: Overfits to corpus words\n",
    "   - Too general: Loses valuable pattern information\n",
    "   - Solution: N-gram probabilities provide right balance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context Utilization**\n",
    "   - Early game: Limited context, rely on position-based HMM\n",
    "   - Mid game: Some revealed letters, use bigrams heavily\n",
    "   - Late game: Strong context, trigrams very powerful\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Worked Well\n",
    "\n",

    "- Separate models for each word length\n",
    "- Laplace smoothing prevents overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **N-gram Conditional Probabilities**\n",
    "- Bigrams capture local dependencies\n",
    "- Trigrams provide strong context signals\n",
    "- Interpolated smoothing handles unseen combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Adaptive Weighting**\n",
    "- Dynamically adjust probability source weights\n",
    "- Increase context weight as more letters revealed\n",
    "- Balance exploration vs. exploitation\n",

    "### What Didn't Work\n",
